	Added	Sample-RecordAndPlayback example to demonstrate recoding and playback on ARI
	Added	Simple caller mute to bridge sample (3 to mute, 4 to unmute all channels)
	Added	New SimpleConf samples project. This is a rough implementation of a conference system written in Arke.ARI. There is currently
			very little error checking and is only for demonstration and testing purposes. However please feel free to add to it and point out any
			silly errors or mistakes.

			Currently not all the conference states work, and it's only the most basic functionality currently implemented. However it does what it 
			should, it lets multple people talk! Gives announcements for on join and leave events, allows callers to mute themselves, and unmute. :)

			Currently known issues: 
			1. Sometimes on second caller joining, DTMF stops working
			2. Announcements for Join and Leaver overlap the name of the caller
			3. Sometimes the recording stops before the caller says anything, might be silence detection being too short
